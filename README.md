# WE_Hackathon
To understand the data better we need to perform a machine learning algorithms to analys the data and get useful information.
# DATASET
The dataset contains resemues and CV's for different candidates nominated for certain job positions. In addition to learning courses.
# Model
## Model 1
  This model is based on combining two matrices, the first one is numerical matrix and the second one is categorical matrix.
  The combined matrix will be the main matrix i.e (ground truth) that will be compared against the given resume.
## Model 2
  This model is built based on the relation between the job title and the corresbonding course that has/must be taken. 
  Given the job and the course, a new column was added and enriched by openAI/GPT3 to predict the outcome skills of this course.
- Both models uses TF-IDF and similar approahes to compute the result.
# Result 
We need to play with the data to deliver an AI solution for the future of work and improve leadership position based on the skills and the courses the applicatns have in addition to resumes information.
