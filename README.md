# WE_Hackathon 🚀
To understand the data better, we need to perform machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and extract useful information. 📊

## DATASET 📋
The dataset contains resumes and CVs for different candidates nominated for certain job positions, in addition to learning courses. 📄

## Models 🤖
- ### Model 1
  This model is based on combining two matrices: the first one is a numerical matrix, and the second one is a categorical matrix. The combined matrix will be the main matrix, i.e., the ground truth, that will be compared against the given resume. 📊
- ### Model 2
  This model is built based on the relation between the job title and the corresponding course that has/must be taken. Given the job and the course, a new column was added and enriched by OpenAI/GPT3 to predict the outcome skills of this course. 🤝
- Both models use TF-IDF and similar approaches to compute the result. 📈

## Result 🎯
We need to analyze the data to deliver an AI solution for the future of work and improve leadership positions based on the skills and the courses the applicants have, in addition to resume information. 🌟
